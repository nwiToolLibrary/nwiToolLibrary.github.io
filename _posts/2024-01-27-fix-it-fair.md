<!--more-->

Porter County Recycling organizes an on-going series of Fix-It Fairs. Participants can bring their broken items to be fixed by volunteers. Their January event is co-sponsored by NWI Tool Library, and we will be attending as volunteer fixers. 

Participants and volunteer fixers must register ahead of time. For registration and more information, see Porter County Recycling's [Fix-It Fair](https://portercountyrecycling.org/fix-it-fairs/) page.
